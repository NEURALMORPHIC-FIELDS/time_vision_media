# TimeVision — Brand & Domain Research

## Proposed Brand Name

**TimeVision** (or **Time Vision Media**)

The name operates on three semantic levels:

| Word | Meaning 1 (Functional) | Meaning 2 (Aspirational) |
|------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Time** | Time-based tracking — the core mechanism | Your time has value |
| **Vision** | Viewing / watching content | A new vision for how media works |
| **Media** | The industry | The medium of exchange |

**Tagline:** *"Your time decides where your money goes."*

**Acronym:** TVM — clean, works for app icons, stock tickers, branding.

## Domain Research (conducted February 15, 2026)

### timevisionmedia.com — TAKEN (but abandoned)

| Detail | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Registrar** | GoDaddy |
| **Current owner** | Small advertising agency in Nagpur/Pune, India |
| **Website** | Static business card site, not a streaming platform |
| **Last content update** | December 2020 (5+ years ago) |
| **Copyright on site** | ©2020 |
| **Blog / News activity** | Zero |
| **Wayback Machine 2024-2025** | Only 301 redirects — site barely functional |
| **Domain expiration** | September 2026 |
| **Domain protection** | Locked (clientDeleteProhibited, clientTransferProhibited) |
| **Assessment** | Effectively abandoned. Auto-renewed by registrar. Owner likely unaware of renewal |

**Options:**
- Contact owner directly — estimated acquisition cost: 200–500€
- Wait for expiration (September 2026) — use backorder service (NameJet, SnapNames)
- Use alternative domains in the meantime

### tvm.tv — TAKEN (for sale)

| Detail | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Current state** | Parked domain — GoDaddy "For Sale" lander page |
| **Content** | Zero — only a sale landing page |
| **Wayback Machine** | Practically empty across all years |
| **Owner** | Domain speculator (GoDaddy aftermarket) |
| **Assessment** | Premium short domain. Never used for any real business |

**Options:**
- Purchase through GoDaddy aftermarket — estimated price: 2,000–10,000€ (negotiable)
- Short premium domains (.tv) hold value but speculators often accept lower offers

### Available Domains (verified February 15, 2026)

All of the following domains had **no DNS resolution** at the time of checking, indicating they are likely available for immediate registration:

| Domain | Price Estimate | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **timevision.tv** | ~15-25€/year | **TOP PICK** — short, memorable, perfect TLD for media |
| **timevision.eu** | ~10-15€/year | **TOP PICK** — European cooperative identity |
| **timevisionmedia.eu** | ~10-15€/year | Full brand name + EU identity |
| **timevisionmedia.tv** | ~15-25€/year | Full brand name + media TLD |
| **timevisionmedia.io** | ~30-40€/year | Tech/startup positioning |
| **timevisionmedia.co** | ~25-30€/year | Alternative to .com |
| **timevision.media** | ~25-35€/year | Descriptive new TLD |
| **timevisionmedia.media** | ~25-35€/year | Redundant but available |

### Taken (not available)

| Domain | Status |
|--------|--------|
| timevision.app | Registered (active) |
| timevisionmedia.com | Registered (abandoned — see above) |
| tvm.tv | Registered (for sale — see above) |

### Recommended Strategy

```
IMMEDIATE (cost: ~30€):
  → Register timevision.tv + timevision.eu
  → Use timevision.tv as primary brand domain
  → Use timevision.eu for legal/corporate identity

SHORT-TERM (optional, cost: negotiable):
  → Attempt to acquire tvm.tv through GoDaddy
  → Contact timevisionmedia.com owner for purchase

LONG-TERM:
  → If timevisionmedia.com is not renewed (Sept 2026),
    acquire through backorder service
  → Consider timevision.com if it becomes available
```
